<li>The components are given on the right side of the simulator. You can click on the desred component and drag it to the simulator screen.</li>
<li>Connection wires are provided. The connection can be confirmed by noticin the colour change in the node. </li>
<li>First,design the original circuit,and then notice the current and voltage through the load resistance. </li>
<li>Then calculate the Thevenin's equivalent resistance and voltage.Design Thevenin's equivalent circuit.Measure the current through the load resistance.</li>
<li>Compare the two results to verify the theorem.</li>
