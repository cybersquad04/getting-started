## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Verification of Thevenin's Theorem.

### 1. Story Outline:
In this experiment , it is aimed to introduce Thevenin's Theorem to students for simplifying circuit analysis .This theorem will be separately applied to linear circuits 

The objective of the experiment is to study Thevenin's Theorem and calculate the load current in the circuit.
### 2. Story:
Any two terminal linear network containing energy sources and resistances can be replaced with an equivalent circuit containing a single voltage source Eth in series with resistance Rth.
Eth is open circuit voltage measured across the two terminals and Rth is the resistance measured between the two terminals with all energy sources can be replaced by their internal resistances.

1.<u>Equivalent Resistance</u>:-It is a way of indicating total resistance which we calculate differently for series and parallel circuits.
The formula used for calculating equivalent resistance
For series combination is: 
     Req=R1+R2.
For Parallel combination:
     Req = (R1*R2)/(R1+R2).
2.<u>Equivalent Voltage:-</u>We need to reconnect the two voltages back into the circuit, and Vs=Vab the current flowing around the loop is calculted as:
     I=(V2-V1)/(R1+R2)
