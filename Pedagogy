#### 3. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. 
<br>
<div>
    The quizes are provided that will judge and inhance the skills of the Student.
    Each question is relevent to the experiment and just ment to increse the understanding of experiment and their concept.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What students will do? | What Simulator will do ? | Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator will ask for Amplitude,Vmax,Vmin and will give Modulation index,and total power | This will test give the result of the experiment 
2.| Student will click on Simulation tab | Simulator opens the quizes on  screen | This will test the understandindg of experiment of student
